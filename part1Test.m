% Fall 2017 ECE 2200, Shazam Part I Test
% Instruction:
% The program will first ask you to write your NetIDs. Please enter in form

% Then the program will automatically run your Shazam program on 10 songs.
% As the program compltes, it will save the following parameters:
% 1. credit: Part I test credit (max: 10, min: 0)
% 2. correct: names of a song that identified correctly
% 3. incorrect: names of a song that identified incorrectly
% 4. time: the time in second that the Shazam program took for running 10 songs.
% You can load [netID1]_[netID2]_part_I_test.mat to check your
% performance.
