% Fall 2017 ECE 2200, Shazam Competition - Database test
% Instruction:
% The program will first ask you to write your NetIDs. Please enter in form
% of [netID1]_[netID2]. 
% Then the program will automatically run your Shazam program on 20 clips.
% As the program compltes, it will save the following parameters:
% 1. credit: Database test credit (max: 0.6, min: 0.0)
% 2. correct: names of a song that identified correctly
% 3. incorrect: names of a song that identified incorrectly
% 4. noDecision: names of a song that identified as no-decision
% 5. time: the time in second that the Shazam program took for running 20
% clips.
% You can load [netID1]_[netID2]_database_test.mat to check your
% performance.
